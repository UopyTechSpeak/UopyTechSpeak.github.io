# Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm UopyTechSpeak!  

## Glad to see you here!  

Dear GitHub developers:

Hello everyone! I am UopyTechSpeak, a junior high school student from China. During my time in programming, I have developed a strong interest in HarmonyOS development and have been persistently studying the principles behind it.

So far, I have mastered the basic knowledge of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JS, Python, HarmonyOS, and C++. Using the knowledge I have learned, I mainly engage in the development of front-end static websites. Through continuous learning and practice, I have also accumulated a lot of experience. Next, I have further plans. I plan to launch some websites with front-end and back-end interaction functions. I am well aware that this will be a challenging yet very interesting exploration process, and I hope to continuously improve my development skills in this process!

I am looking forward to communicating with everyone here and discussing programming related knowledge and experience together.

I hope everyone can add more stars!
